      <h1><b>Personas Assignment</b></h1>
        <ul>
            <p><b> Explanation: </b> &nbsp;For this project, I selected an interface in public and observed how random users interacted with the interface. Afterward, I interviewed 
                three users at random and asked them questions about their experiences using the interface. Then, from the responses I received from the user interviews,
                I constructed two personas that represent a common user for that interface, and drew a storyboard based on one of the personas.

        <p> <b>Interview Questions: </b></p>
        &nbsp;
        &nbsp;
        <p>1. Did you know how you should be interacting with this interface right away?</p>
        <p>2. What were some unexpected challenges while using the kiosk to order?</p>
        <p>3. Did you think the card reader was straightforward to use?</p>
        &nbsp;
        &nbsp;

        <p>
            <b>1) Write a few sentences or bullets describing the key observations you gained from observing your users.     </b>   </p>
            &nbsp;
            <p><b>Observation:  </b>&nbsp;Most of the users did not have much trouble getting through the ordering process.
            But, users who used the card reader seemed to be confused about the checkout process. This is because
            upon observation, tne user who
            used Apple Pay was able to tap his card to the card reader machine and complete the transaction
            right away, but another user who used her credit card to transact struggled to complete the payment
            because the screen did not update until she pulled her card out of the card reader, and before that
            the screen showed no changes. </p>

            <ul>
                &nbsp;
                <p><b>1. Did you know how you should be interacting with this interface right away?</b></p>
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                <p> - Most users said that they knew right away how to interact with this interface, because they instinctively knew how to use the touch screen, and also because the screen
                    instructed them to touch the screen to get started with ordering.
                </p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><b>2. What were some unexpected challenges while using the kiosk to order?</b></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p>
                    - The users who used credit card as their means to pay for boba said that they found using the card reader less straightforward. They said that
                    unless they pulled their card out from the reader, the screen didn't show that the transaction was underway, which made the process confusing. But, they eventually
                    figured out how the transaction worked.
                </p>
                <p> - Contrastingly, users who used Apple Pay seemed to find the payment process more straightforward because they just tapped the card reader and their payment was processed. </p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><b>3. Did you think the card reader was straightforward to use?</b></p>
                <p>
                    - Quote: "No, not really. The place where you have to put the card in is hard to find because it's all black." 
                    According to this quote, users seemed to think that the color of the card reader made it less straightforward to use. 
                </p>
                <p> - Users remarked that the card reader was hard to find also because it was beneath a large screen, which cast a shadow onto it.</p>
